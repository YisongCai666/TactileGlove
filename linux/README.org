Tactile Glove software

The software is split in two parts: a console program and a GUI program (in corresponding sub dirs).

** console
The console program supports two output modes
- console
- ROS publisher (to /TactileGlove)

** GloveViz GUI
The GUI program correspondingly supports several input modes
- read directly from serial device
- read from ROS publisher
- generate random values (for testing purposes)

If no ROS/catkin environment is found during build, ROS support is disabled.
